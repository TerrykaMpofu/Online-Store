# Online-Store
An online store, also known as e-commence store, allows customers to browse and purchase items while providing secure payment processing and shipping.
In this project,we  designed and implemented a simplified online store. In our online store, there will be numerous products in many categories. Customers can browse the products, add them to their shopping carts, and
proceed to checkout.

The online store system supports two user roles: employee and customer. Administrators are responsible for creating employee accounts and assigning employee IDs. Customers, on the other hand, will create their own accounts when registering as new users. The system distinguishes between different types of accounts. The administrator account is a database-level account with direct access to manage the database, including creating employee accounts and performing other administrative tasks. In contrast, employee and customer accounts are application-level accounts, which interact with the online store through the
application interface, allowing employees to manage products and customers to shop and manage their orders.
